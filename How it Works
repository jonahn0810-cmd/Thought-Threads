    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Students type letters to seniors.</li>
        <li>Letters are reviewed for safety and privacy.</li>
        <li>Letters are printed and delivered to the retirement home.</li>
        <li>Seniors write replies; staff reviews them.</li>
        <li>You receive typed responses back from seniors.</li>
        <li>The process repeats, building ongoing connections.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Letters are exchanged once a month to ensure meaningful engagement and manageable workflow.</p>
